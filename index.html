        <p>
                I'm Marley Jacobs, born in San Francisco, California. I'm currently a student in Philadelphia, at Drexel University. 
                My major is Entertainment and Arts Management with a focus in Digital Media, with two minors in Business Administration 
                and Writing. I'm in my senior year of school, and I'm looking for a job where I can use what I learned from all my classes 
                and Co-ops.<br>
                <br>
                As a designer and writer I've mainly wrote short fiction, and worked on some games for classes, both tabletop and digital. 
                I was the lead designer on Ace of Survival, and on that project I wrote the background lore and story for the game. It was a new take 
                on the swipe to make decisions genre. Instead of swiping to make decision left or right like in other games, you would bet and depending 
                on that you could succeed or fail. Besides that I created the tabletop game Loot Bag, a two player competitive card game that involved 
                pulling cards from a bag and equipping them to defeat your opponent.<br>
                <br>
                I'm a creative, quick working problem solver. I've worked for The Mission Entertainment and Skycatch in the past, and at both jobs 
                I not only got a lot of work done, but I created more efficient ways of working that are still being used today. 
                At The Mission Entertainment I was part of a team that worked to categorize and organize a massive list of all public domain stories 
                from books to news articles and beyond. When I joined I realized we were doing a lot of redundant work so I organized the team so 
                that we worked like a factory line. At Skycatch I was tasked with organizing our leads by their status with us. I ended up 
                creating a workflow that they are still using. I'm looking to find work in the entertainment industry, but I have a wide array 
                of skillets and interests. I'm very interested in producing, and writing for TV, Movies, or games. I also discovered a passion 
                for marketing ops during my last job at Skycatch. I'm interested in seeing what other marketing jobs are out there. Thanks for 
                taking the time to read about me and I hope we'll be in contact soon about a job interview.<br>
