../ means to go out a level

    <a href="httP:// link.com" targets = "blahblahblah">Linkname</a> 
    this means that you can keep calling it by the blahblahblah

Moving up down page ankor:
id attribute can be applied to any element and it's a unique identifier. 
by calling it later, you will move to where it is on the page.

attribute: <thing id="value">text to click name in browser</thing>
Refferencing an id uses the #
<h1 id="top">top of page</h1>
<a href="#arc">arc shot</a>

ul is unordered listlist
<ul>
    <li>enter billing info</li>
    <li> blah balald</li>
</ul>
ordered list is ol, and isntead of bullet points, it numbers them.

definition list, definition term, definitiion d
<dl>
    <dt> my term</dt>

images neet alt tag:

<img src=""

how to get each file type on the web
jpg
gif
png
svg
___

when using an image, resolution should be 72 pixels to inches
crop and resize image to size needed for webpage.
minimize quality to not change the picture badly, but not take up too much data. file size should be low b4 quality suffers
use save for web for every picture ur gonna load on ur webpage. 

div stands for division. it's an abritrary box
div is like a sub folder. you can call it at any time to do everything within, like the python project. 
<div id="header">
    <h1>Insert headder</h1>
</div>

span element: span is an inline elemnent. creates extra structure so that css can change it later. 
<p><span id="welcome">welcome to the jungle</span>. we have some&hellip;</p>

block element is a box. it takes up as much space as it possible can. when it closes, thereis an auto line breaker.
    can make divs within divs. 
    (ex: paragraph. stretches as far to the right as it can) ex, also headings. nothing is to the right of them
Inline element takes up as little space as possible. 
    (ex: a bold of text inside a div tag. it only bolds the letters selected. other example is ankering a link)

in html5 u can do better. 
you can create a div within a div for navigation, and you can have a sidebar, and a footer. now u can make each primary are
are multiple areas. inside each sidebar there are multiple stories, and now there are a ton of divs and its hard to read and lots
of nesting errors. there is no content and it's already stressfull. div element is simmanticly inert. browser can't read the
id of the headder for example.

html5 lets you include simantic elements:
instead of <div id=head> can just use V
<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<main></main>
<aside></aside>
<footer></footer>

use these html5 elements when they are appropriate. use divs when u need additional styling.

suggested hw ex:


new file V
html top file stuff



CSS:
x-name, aka the property
h1 {
    Anything in here is the property rule set for all h1
    
    /* property: Value / * <- this is a title, not part of the code

    color: navy; /*this is a decleration
    EX:
    border-bottom: 2px solid #ff; /* add line bellow h2 headings This si the comment of CSS*/ 
}

Build structure and then present structuee. if structure is good, u can easily style it

EX:
html:

<body>
    <h1 class="base_color">student materials</h1>
    <p>Here are the downloads:</p>
    <ul id="links">
        <li><a href="exercises.html">exercises</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p id="copyright" Class="base_color">&copu'2016</p>
</body>

ID has to be unique, for 1 distinct thing you can modify with a css
class is for multiple, and an element can have multiple elements. shared style

CSS:

*{

}     --This is the universal selecter. selects everything/all elements

*{
    margin:.5em 1em;
}

body {
    font-family:arial, sans-serif;
}     -- type selector, applies style based around what the html element is. all body will have these styles
h1 { font-size: 180%;}
all h1 would have these conditions? --

2nd type of selector applies to a single html element based on ID element
Use # symbol to call an id

#copyright {
    font-size: 75%;
    text-align: right;
}

.base_color {color: blue;}


External style sheet
HTML:

<link
    rel="stylesheet" --relationship, what it is
    href="/css/master.css" --- points to the file aka the style sheet
    media="screen" --- built for screen 
    charset="utf-8"
>


Embedded styles:

<head>
    <style>
    body{
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    h1 {
    font-size: 130%;
    }
    </style>
</head>

At the top of the doc. 





3rd version: inline.

<h1 style="font-size: 250%; color: red;">
    town hall
</h1>
dont do it this way, it is messy and time consuming


CSS means more than one can be applied to the same page.
two or more rules for the same proeprty are applied to the same element. the cascade order determines which rule takes precedence

Cascade order is a specific orer of how things are applied. 
Cascade order:
first thing it looks for is all the things in the users style sheet that are marked as important. not the style sheet you write,
the users personal preferences. browsers have a preference page. 
next comes the important rules in a web page. 
normal rules in a web page
norml rules in a user style sheet
default rules in the web browser

at the bottom of the sheet, mark something as important to make it overwrite everything else

.highlight {
    font-weight: bold !important;
}

p.highlight {color:red;}
p/highlight {color:blue;}
When the text looks at this, the priority are the same, but the second rule overides the first. the last appleid becomes true.

measurements:
px for pixels
pt for points 1/72 of an inch
em for ems> (em1 is current font size)
% for size (relative to base font size so 100% is normal.)
vw is viewort width
vh is viewport hight

check how to get to slide tha thas list of color + names

can also use hexcodes for color or rgb
some properties are inherited by children, some arent. u can always overide

rgba(a is opacity)
HSL
HSLA (hue-degrees, saturation, lightness, opacty value)

how to select individual part of a thign called.
EX:

(that's the first perafraph of each subtopic)
h2+p{
    
}


.speakers li { font-size: 18px; }
list items within the all lists with speakers class. 


psuedo-selector:
a:visited
a:hover
a:active
a:focus (blue glow or outline, aka highlight)

normalzie style sheet sets margins to 0 so theres no space between edge of the browser and the body.
sets default faunt family to somethign standard. to sizing, spacing, etc.... gets rid of rounded corner/
ends inconsistencies. 
can save normaliae fiel as part of css. can setup and link to the normalzie page. write ur styles on top of normalzie sheet. or use
reset css. 

develouper tools: if you have problems, and u need to test it etc... open up browsers, or you could use devlouper tools to help 
with that stuff. it will give all info that th ebrowser sees and debug 

Get connected to servers. Should be able to publish 





Check slack for FTP
file transfer protocal

FTP programs, cyberduck
programs Login through drexel's irt to install fetch
drexel.edu/irt/computers-software/software/

go to students/windows
Need to use your hostname: marleymansplace.com
user: x
pass: x
conect using: FTP

hit connect, and ur connected to the server. 

once u connect, you will find a bunch of folders, don't delete anything. this is ur space on their server. it's what
makes the website work. 

look for public_html folder.
anything you put in that folder, it is public.

the rest of the default stuff is fine, leave it. you can add dif folders for your own thing

inside there's a lot of files, like cgi-bin, or 404.html, or 500.html, error 
in this folder, the public one, you gonna add folders, and they are gonna be available in the browser
mirror ur dev system. 

DON'T WORK ON THE FILED DIRECTLY ON THE SERVER. MAKE A COPY. Make a copy, locally, and edit the local places and then upload
and replace the real server one.

make changes on comp, and when ready on files, then upload all onto the server and replace them.

rework locally
test locally
upload to live
test on live
commit to repository
push to github


need to connect to server when on site using ftp, then should see server files.
